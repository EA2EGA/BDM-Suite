Change log
==========

Version 1.0 - 06-Sep-2012
-------------------------
First release, only included DUMP and FLASH scripts

Version 1.1 - 26-May-2013
-------------------------
Added a new CHECKECU script to calculate the 'FB' checksum. This is a much
faster way of checking that FLASHing was succesful than the alternative of
DUMPing after FLASHing and then comparing files using dos 'fc'.

Allowed editing the filename in case of making mistakes when typing it.

Corrected a problem preventing the scripts working with T8 ECUs. Version 1.0
did not work for T8 ECUs because of a memory problem. To be quite honest I am
still confused, but the MC68377 reference manual is ambiguous when describing
its SRAM Module configuration.

Several small bug fixes and improvements for reporting errors.

Version 1.2 - 01-Dec-2013
-------------------------
Added a new ERASEECU script which erases the FLASH chips. Separately erasing
is not usually necessary, but this script also uses my 'brute force' algorithm
which may help to revive 'bad' 28F010 FLASH chips.

Added Support for ATMEL 29C010 FLASH chips (finally!)

FIXED a serious bug for T5.2/5 ECUS. which prevented the scripts working
and displayed the '3: Error: Unrecognised ECU or FLASH chips' message.
This was due to a timing issue with the FLASH programming voltage and meant
that I couldn't reliably detect 28F010 or 28F512 FLASH chips!

More improvements for reporting errors.
Improved control of FLASH programming voltage.
Imroved fileneme editing in FLASHECU and DUMPECU scripts
